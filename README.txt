HOMEWORK LOCATION:

COMPLEXITY [EASY / HARD]: Moderate 

I think the reason the last assignment was so difficult is because I implemented the model that wanted to be used in this assignment.  Since I already worked through that model, this assignment went by quicker than I anticipated.  I feel like I’m starting to grasp how thinks connect a little better. 
 

APPROXIMATION OF HOURS INVESTED IN ASSIGNMENT:
3 hours on participation
5 hours on homework


EXPECTED GRADE: A


DESCRIBE APPLICATION INTENT:
It takes a user inputs a search field: either “name” or “doctor” (case doesn’t matter) and then a search value the program searches a list of patients either by first name or doctor. 

Then for any hits it returns all of the elements of the patient, including the rendered image.


This application assumes a continuous string is entered for field, followed by a space, followed by one continuous string for value.
