COMPLEXITY [EASY / HARD]:
HARD. Syntax killed me, but this is why I joined this class.  To learn how to do things in these languages. 

Also a bit complicated trying to figure out how each piece works together, but this exercise really helped me start to learn it in a trial-by-fire manner.  Which I think is one of the best ways to learn. 

APPROXIMATION OF HOURS INVESTED IN ASSIGNMENT:
Participation: 3 hours
Homework: 5.5 hours

EXPECTED GRADE: A

DESCRIBE APPLICATION INTENT:
	The application provides a simple UI to the user.  It takes a first and last name as an input into the name field.  Once entered, the user hits the submit button and receives the email that corresponds to the first and last name that was entered. 

	The overall application view displays the name, input box, search button, and the list of names AFTER the email.  I did it this way because it felt better visually than putting the email result below the list. 

	In the class component view, the app displays the email title and the result.  If the name entered doesn't exist, then an error message will display.
